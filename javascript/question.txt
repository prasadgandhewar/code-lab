Common leak patterns:

Global references — unintentionally storing large objects on window or module global.
Closures holding large objects — e.g., a long-lived closure keeps a large array alive.
Detached DOM nodes — DOM elements removed from document but still referenced in JS.
Timers and intervals — setInterval or timers not cleared.
Event listeners — not removed when element/component unmounts (especially on nodes removed).
Caches without eviction — Map/array caches that grow unbounded (use WeakMap/WeakRef if needed).

Prevention:

Unsubscribe listeners and clear intervals in useEffect cleanup or componentWillUnmount.
Use WeakMap/WeakSet for caches keyed by objects.
Limit cache size; implement eviction (LRU).
Avoid storing DOM nodes in long-lived JS structures.
